# Inline Node Tutorials

This repository contains tutorials on how to use Cursive's new
[Inline Node Customisation](https://cursive-ide.com/blog/customising-inline-nodes.html) features with real-world examples. Detailed
documentation on the API is in the [Inline Nodes](https://github.com/cursive-ide/inline-nodes)
repo, which also contains the implementations of the support functions used in
these tutorials.

To use these examples, you will need to be using at least version
[1.14.0-eap2](https://cursive-ide.com/blog/cursive-1.14.0-eap2.html) of Cursive. Instructions on how to sign up for 
the EAPs (if you're not already) are
[here](https://cursive-ide.com/userguide/#choosing-to-receive-eap-beta-builds).

To get started, clone this repo and
[import it into Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com/userguide/deps.html#quick-project-import). Then
open up the `cursive.tutorials.inline.a-start-here` namespace and follow the instructions there.

If you have any questions or comments about this, the best place is probably `#cursive` in
the Clojurians Slack. Otherwise you can also use our [mailing lists](https://cursive-ide.com/mailinglist.html) or just email me
directly on [cursive@cursive-ide.com](mailto:cursive@cursive-ide.com).
